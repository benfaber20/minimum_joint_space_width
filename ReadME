1) Outline points are needed to use this script. BoneFinder is freely available software to do this automatically or manually (http://bone-finder.com). The model to 
place the points automatically which was built on 1930 DXAs in UK Biobank is available there. 

2) The outline points need to provided in the format shown by example_pointsfile.txt (please see alpha_angle repository). Each row after the "{" is an x,y coordinate for the points. 
The row after "{" will be read as point 0 by the code. The next row is point 1, the next row point 2 and so on and so forth until "}" ends the points file.  

3) These points files need to be stored in the same folder

4) A list of points files needs to be provided for the script - see example_list.txt (please see alpha_angle repository)

5) The code is written in Python 3 and best opened in Jupyter Notebook where each function is a cell

6) You will need to identify the acetabular and femoral points over which you want to measure the minimum joint space width. 
#defining mJSW
    acetabulum = list(range(END_POINT_NUMBER,START_POINT_NUMBER_MINUS_1,-1)) #ACETABULAR POINTS - note python does not count initial point so "(84,77,-1)" would be points 78-84 inclusive
    #print (acetabulum),
    fem_head = list(range(START_POINT_NUMBER, END_POINT_NUMBER_PLUS_1})) #"(22,32)" would be points 22-31 inclusive
    #print (fem_head)
